# estuary view functions 

  1. open a new browser tab at https://estuary.mcmaster.ca
  2. go to solo mode
  3. enter into the terminal: 

*See what views are available*
```
!listviews
```
*choose a view to display locally (your pc only) from above output*
```
!presetview n
```
*set the current view for all users in the ensemble*
```
!publishview def
```
 *return to the default view on your local display*
```
!presetview def
```
*see what code generated the current view*
```
!dumpview
```
*list all samples*
```
!localview audiomap
```
*show visuals only, on the local display*
```
!localview []
```
*display `iframes` in cells, checkout vdo.ninja*
```
!localview $ grid 2 2 [iFrame "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4hero",code 0 0,code 1 0,iFrame "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4hero"]
```
*horizontal split*
```
!localview $ grid 1 2 [code 0 0, code 0 1]
```
*horizontal cells, removed all gridlines, menus etc*
```
!localview $ grid 1 6 [code 1 0 [nomenu, noeval],code 3 0 [nomenu, noeval],code 5 0 [nomenu, noeval],code 7 0 [nomenu, noeval],code 9 0 [nomenu, noeval],code 11 0 [nomenu, noeval]]
```
Since there's no menu to pick the language you have to do it with the first line of the code...

# JSoLang reuse vars example

## What is it?

A way to define a new livecoding meta-language on the fly (live) in estuary(!)

It uses peg.js as a parser (peg.js provide an online parser for debugging too)

See [here](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary/tree/dev/JSoLangs) for more examples 

## How to

This example is like a replacement for `let` in tidal - define reusable code referenced via variables

eval in a low number panel

```
##JSoLang vars

// note variable name defs here
main = x:allRules* { return "##tidal\n" + x.join("") }
allRules = chords / kickpat / anyCharacter
anyCharacter = .

// specific replacement rules, the i makes the find operation
// case insensitive
chords = "chords"i { return "<[c4'm9'8@1.5 af'maj9@1 g4'dom7@1.5 ] c4'm9'16 c'm9'12>" }
kickpat = "kickpat"i { return "<[10000[01]0[01]] [1 1 1 0]>" }

```

use the `chords` and `kickpat` patterns in another panel

```
##vars

struct "kickpat"
$ note (arp "<[up down thumbup] down down>" "chords")
# s "sid"
```
