### Tidal Contributions
**How do you contribute to Tidal Cycles? What have you worked on?**

Heh. I think I've had a go at just about everything

- I maintain a [Linux installer](https://github.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles)
- I've added a few [simple patches to](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/commits?author=cleary)/nutted out ideas for tidal itself, particularly around the [chords module](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/rfc-working-on-making-chord-naming-chordlist-more-consistent/2717)
- I've written [bits of documentation](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/commits?author=cleary)
- I often [play in](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdg8PPpRgsw4w9bSmX5JY7b), and have helped organise some of the Solstice Marathon Livestreams
- I am active on the [forums](https://club.tidalcycles.org/u/cleary/summary) and the discord support channels
- For the last 2 years I've been hosting a weekly collaborative (mostly tidal) livecoding session called [WeekendJam](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjfCNVBK2O0W0_nwiSgWIoFR) for anyone to come along and have a jam with me
- I've written and run tidal-based [workshops](https://decoded.livecode.au), online and [in](https://allevents.in/griffith/decoded-%E2%80%94%E2%80%94-an-artistic-livecoding-workshop/200022125384118) [person](https://infrequency.au/) to try and network/raise the profile of the [livecoding scene in Australia](http://www.ozchi.org/2022/creativity.html)


**What motivates you to be a Tidal contributor?**

The community is lovely, they give/have given me a lot and I like to return that where I can. The project allows for such vast and varied possibilities in learning and creation, and that's what keeps me interested. The focus on inclusivity, sharing and generally "anti-gatekeeping" is a huge drawcard for me too

I particularly enjoy the WeekendJams though - I get to meet new people, share inspirations with all the different ideas all mashed together, learn, and just generally have a great time. I've made some great friends through jams.

### Livecoding
- What do you like about livecoding in Tidal?

It's concise, it's (fairly) self-explanatory, and it's very easy to be both creatively specific and random as required

- How do you approach your livecoding sessions? Do you use prepared code? Do you start with a blank slate?

For solo performances, I prepare something - usually a "scaffolded" set of code which allows for creative path choosing during the set

For the WeekendJam sessions, I never prepare anything beyond the occasional group idea for exploration (which is broached 5 mins before start time)

- What functions and coding approaches do you like to use? (examples?)

I tend to make a point to separate my rhythmic and harmonic elements for easy reuse (`struct` and `n`/`note`) - which is a hangover from the collaborative nature of the WeekendJam sessions.

- Do you use Tidal with other tools / environments?

I've done some external software synth control (Vital/Yoshimi), I also have a Midi Fighter Twister controller which sometimes gets a run - I tend to keep it pretty vanilla though, particularly since doing the workshop tours last year

Also, [estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca) of course

### Music
- Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?

Varied? I don't really know much about genres - for more musical stuff, I tend to make use of western music theory. If I'm doing solely rhythmic stuff I tend to try and push myself [outside my common use 4/4 6/8 time signatures](https://youtu.be/to1_4id_oyc) - the few patterns I did for [#patternuary this year](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdh9SJqIQeku8u9g1acI5Y5) probably highlight that variety fairly well

- How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?

Yeah, _a lot_ - I played "traditional" instruments before I started, the biggest evolution has involved trying to break out of all the subconscious composer lockin that comes with that (fixed tempos, chords limited by number of fingers/how far they can stretch, increasing the number of simultaneous voices). It's moved from what I could do on a guitar/bass/piano with 10 fingers and a looper to beyond orchestral possibilities (and exposed my lack of compositional knowledge in that area!).

- What samples or instruments do you like to work with?

Anything :) I've been trying to get more comfortable [working with break samples](https://youtu.be/JsZPN3yqu2s) a bit lately

- What projects are you currently working on / planning? What's next?

I'd like to develop the livecode.au domain into a tool for organisation/promotion of Australian livecoding events/personalities, that one is going to take more time than I currently have available, so it's on the backburner for now (unless anyone wants to give me hand!)

To try and claw back a little time, I'm looking at sharing the WeekendJam load a little, and hopefully moving it into a general stream/yt account so that multiple organisers can have control depending on availability.

I'd also like to finish and release some music, just to learn a bit more about the whole process chain - that's a hope item for this year :)

### Other

Just a big thankyou for all the people I've chatted to/jammed with/learned from over the years, you've all been a huge inspiration, and I'm very glad to have been able to share my livecoding journey with you
