# Creating a Livecoding Workshop for Kids - Lessons Learned

## Introduction

In September 2024, I embarked on my first major livecoding workshop project in a couple of years, in conjunction with a local kids shop/art/music/maker space aiming at kids aged 10 and up.

My son started getting drum lessons there, and after several (wide ranging) discussions with the owners about their interests and goals for the shop, I proposed doing these livecoding workshops and they loved the idea since exploring tech in a creative context was a gap they wanted to fill in their curriculum.

Some key things about the relationship with the venue:
