## Setup Cells!

 - Left Cell: `Punctual`
 - Right Cell: `MiniTidal`

## Controlling Brightness

Once we start moving things around, visuals can start getting very bright and flashy which, depending on your audience can be quite dangerous.

We can control the brightness of that final value by appending a brightness value to the end of our function - try this in the **Punctual** column

```
circle [0] 0.25 * 1 >> video;
```
By default, Punctual uses a brightness value of `1` so you can get away without specifying it (try/compare it!)
```
circle [0] 0.25 >> video;
```

You can reduce the brightness by half by changing the `1` to `0.5` (or half of 1)
```
circle [0] 0.25 * 0.5 >> video;
```

Brightness can also be specified on an individual channel basis. In this example we apply individual brightness values to each of the `red`, `green`, and `blue` (`RGB`) channels in the `video` output by putting each individual brightness value in a comma separated list, surrounded by `[ ]` brackets

```
circle 0 0.25 * [0.25, 0.5, 0.75] >> video;
```

The `blue` channel has the highest value of the three at `0.75` so we would expect our circle to be mostly `blue` coloured - is it? 

## Oscillators

> *What is an Oscillator?*
> 
> An Oscillator is a "Signal Generator", generating a continuous, repeating pattern of signals.
>
> In Punctual, an Oscillator signal generates values between `1` and `0` inclusive

An oscillator in Punctual has a **frequency value** that lets you specify the speed with which the oscillator moves between `0` and `1` 

We can replace any number in a Punctual pattern with an **Oscillator**. This includes `x` and `y` coordinates, `radii`, brightness values and more.

***It's important to keep the oscillator frequency value low so it remains visible*** 

This is an example of a `sine` oscillator, notice how the ball in the middle follows the sine wave shape over time. The sine wave has a specific characteristic that it tends to accelerate towards the middle, then decelerate after it passes the mid-point

Notice how our circle follows the same acceleration/deceleration pattern as the ball in the animation when we put the oscillator in the `x` position?

```
circle [(sin 0.25),0] 0.02 >> video;
```

Other oscillator waveforms available in Punctual include: `tri`, `saw`, and `sqr`

## Punctual Functions related to Time and Tempo

We can replace any numbers in Punctual with a Time/Tempo function that gives us changing values relative to the music, or time passing

`ebeat` is the number of beats that have passed since the code was last evaluated

```
hline 0 (1/ebeat) >> video;
```

Other Time and Tempo related functions include:

 - `cps` equivalent to the current tempo in cycles per second (this number doesn't usually change)
 - `time` how much time in seconds has passed since "beat 0" of the tempo, or from when the **first piece of code was evaluated**
 - `beat` how many beats have passed since beat 0 of the tempo, or from when the **first piece of code was evaluated**
 - `etime` how much time in seconds has passed since the **last piece of code was evaluated**

## Audio Frequency Graphs

Punctual has graphs which provide current audio frequency values (ie what sounds estuary is currently producing) and splits them into 3 "bins" - `hi`, `mid`, and `lo`

 - Low frequency sounds (eg a kick drum) create values on the `lo` graph
 - Mid frequency sounds (eg a snare drum) create values on the `mid` graph 
 - High frequency sounds (eg a hihat cymbal) create values on the `hi` graph

Setup a simple sound in the right hand estuary cell (make sure `MiniTidal` is selected from the language dropdown):

```
sound "bd"
```

`bd` is a predominantly low frequency sound (less than 1000Hz), in the left hand cell configure a `rect` who's height is controlled by `lo`

```
rect [0] [0.2,lo] >> blue;
```

Notice how the `rect` height is largest when the `bd` sound is loudest, and how the `rect` size reduces as the `bd` sound fades away? 

The shape of the `lo` graph (and all Audio Graphs) is controlled by the various sound frequencies created in Estuary.

In the punctual cell, try replacing `lo` with the `mid` and `hi` frequency graphs, how do you expect them to react to the `bd` sound?

Pick some different frequency sounds (eg `sd`, `hc`) and see how the different bins react -

# Exercises:

1. Create a vertically moving `circle` using the `sin` oscillator



2. Additionally, in the same cell also create a vertically moving `circle` using the `tri` oscillator at the same frequency



3. Describe the difference you see between `sin` and `tri` (hint, keep the oscillator value 1 or below)



4. Modify our brightness example below, using the `sqr` oscillator to control the circles brightness

```
circle [0] 0.25 * 0.5 >> video;
```


5. Create a simple beat in one column with MiniTidal (`sound "bd"`). Then modify the answer from the previous question to make a circle appear/disappear in time with the beat 


## For Bonus Points

6. Create 3 `rect` objects using the below code, then modify it so each `rect` changes size based on a different audio frequency bin (`lo`, `mid`, `hi`)

```
rect [-0.5,0,0,0,0.5,0] [0.25,0.1,0.25,0.1,0.25,0.1] >> video;
```

7. Create a vertically moving circle using the example code below. Notice the `circle` oscillates between the top and bottom of the screen (`0` and `1`). Try applying an **arithmetic function** to the oscillator, to reduce the distance the circle moves on the y axis

```
circle [0, sin 0.5] 0.25 >> video;
```

8. Investigate the effects of replacing the **frequency value** of an oscillator with another oscillator (nested oscillators!)
