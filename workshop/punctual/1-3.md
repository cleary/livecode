## Setup Cells!

`!presetview twocolumns`

 - Left Cell: `Punctual`
 - Right Cell:  `Punctual`

## Different Output Targets

So far, we've explored the `video` output with it's RGB channels. Punctual has [several more outputs](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#punctual-output-notations) that can be used for a variety of different visual effects

### Individual colours 

You can actually specify each of these individual colour channels as: `red`, `green`, and `blue`

```
circle [0] 0.25 >> blue;
```
### hsv

Another 3 channel output that gives vastly differing results to `video`, is `hsv` (or Hue, Saturation, Value intensities)

In this example, we're setting individual values for each of the 3 `hsv` channels
```
circle [0] 0.25 * [sin 0.25, sin 0.5, 0.75] >> hsv;
```

### alpha

`alpha` is an erase/overwrite channel that will remove any underlying layers when it's passed a value of `1`

`alpha` works best when used in a higher numbered cell - cells increase in priority counted left to right, top to bottom

for this example, make sure both cell languages are set to `Punctual`

In cell [1,1] (left), evaluate: 

```
1 >> blue;
```

In cell [1,2] (the right hand one)
```
circle [0] (sin 0.25) >> alpha;
```
***Note: applying `alpha` in the higher numbered cell is important, alpha won't apply a visible change if these cells were swapped***

### fdbk

`fdbk` is a (currently) undocumented *global* output that affects how long a pixel should take to "fade out". 

A value of `0` is the default state (pixel turns off immediately), and a value of `1` doesn't let the pixels fade out at all!

```
circle [sin 0.25, 0] 0.25 >> blue;
0.8 >> fdbk;
```

***Note: This works best with moving elements***

## Math Functions

Basic arithmetic can be applied inside patterns (addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, exponentiation)

```
-- basic signal
circle [0, (sin 0.2)] 0.25 >> video;

-- addition
circle [0, (sin 0.2)] (0.25 + sin 0.2) >> video;

-- multiplication
circle [0, (sin 0.2)] (0.25*2) >> video;

-- division
circle [0, (sin 0.2)/2] (0.25/2) >> video;

-- exponentiation
circle [0, (sin 0.2)] (0.25**(sin 0.2)) >> video;
```

You can compare the output between two graphs, and take the values only from the graph that matches the comparison function (eg `max`, `min`) 

```
circle [0, max (sin cps) (saw 1)] 0.25 >> video;
```

Punctual also has mathematical comparison functions (`>`, `<`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` and more) that return a "boolean" value ie `1` (true) or `0` (false)

Let's continue with the `circle` examples from above, and try the "equality" function `==`:

```
circle 0 (sin 0.125) == circle 0.2 (tri 0.5) >> video;
```

What are you seeing here? Try identifying different sections of the image and determine what value you think the pixels in that section should have, based on the statement above

Apply the opposite "inequality" operator `!=` instead - think about how you expect the sections of the image to change, do they?

```
circle 0 (sin 0.125) != circle 0.2 (tri 0.5) >> video;
```

There are many more [Punctual Graph Functions](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual/blob/main/REFERENCE.md#punctual-graph-functions)

# Exercises:

1. Take this `hsv` example and fix two of the three elements of `hue`, `saturation`, and `value` while generating values for the third element with an oscillator.
Repeat two more times, each time changing which `hsv` element has the oscillator

```
circle [0] 0.25 * [1, 1, 1] >> hsv;
```

Describe how each of these elements affects your output:

  - `hue`: 
  - `saturation`:
  - `value`:



2. The arithmetic operations can also be applied to patterns themselves. Starting with the example code below, describe what happens when you replace `<operator>` in the code

```
(circle 0 0.25) <operator> (circle 0.15 0.35) >> video;
```

 - addition `+`:
 - subtraction `-`:
 - multiplication `*`
 - division `/`
 - exponent `**`
 - `>` greater than and `>=` or equal to
 - `<` less than and `<=` or equal to
 - `!=` not equal to
 - `max`
 - `min`

## For Bonus Points

3. In our `alpha` example, we subtracted a `circle` from a `blue` screen - can you find a way to invert this effect (ie subtract from `alpha` so you just get a blue circle) by modifying the `alpha` statement only? 

4. Can you create a raindrops on a windscreen/snow effect using oscillator(s), `circle` and `fdbk`?
